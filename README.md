Hi,guys here I created a react app of Hospital Management System.
It contains 3 files-
1.Frontend app(for Patients)
2.Backend(Stores all the messages from Patients,Details of Patients their Appointment and Doctors,also the backend is used to store login infomation of doctors and patients)
3.Docdash-its a dashboard for doctors to view their messages from Patients and their Appointments.

Steps to run-
It's a project made with Reactjs+Vite just download it and write npm init in shell and you are ready to use.
Now write npm run dev and you will be redirected to your browser with the project running on your screen.
